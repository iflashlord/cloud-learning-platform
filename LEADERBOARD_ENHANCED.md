# âœ… Enhanced Leaderboard: Course-Specific Default Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Changes Made

I've successfully updated the leaderboard system to meet your requirements:

### 1. **Course-Specific Tab Selected by Default** âœ…
- **Before**: General leaderboard was the default tab
- **After**: Course leaderboard tab is now selected by default
- **Implementation**: Updated `useState` in `LeaderboardTabs` component

### 2. **Shows Current Active Course Results** âœ…
- **Before**: Required manual course selection
- **After**: Automatically displays leaderboard for user's active course
- **Implementation**: Uses `userProgress.activeCourse.id` as default selection

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

### Updated Files:

#### `/app/(main)/leaderboard/page.tsx`
```typescript
// New logic to use active course as default
const defaultCourseId = userProgress.activeCourse?.id || null;
const selectedCourseId = searchParams.course ? parseInt(searchParams.course) : defaultCourseId;
```

#### `/app/(main)/leaderboard/leaderboard-tabs.tsx`
```typescript
// Default to course tab instead of general
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<"general" | "course">("course");
```

### New User Experience:

#### **Immediate Course Display**
- User lands on leaderboard â†’ **Course tab active by default**
- Shows their **current active course** leaderboard immediately
- **No extra clicks** required to see relevant rankings

#### **Smart Course Switcher**
- **Compact dropdown** instead of large course grid
- Shows current course prominently in header
- **Easy switching** with "Switch to different course" dropdown
- **Preserves selection** in URL for sharing/bookmarking

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Improvements

### Enhanced Course Header
```
[Course Icon] Course Name Leaderboard
Top learners currently studying this course
Switch to different course â–¼ (dropdown)
```

### Dropdown Course Selector
- **Clean, compact design** that doesn't dominate the page
