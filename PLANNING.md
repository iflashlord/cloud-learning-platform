# AWS Learning Platform – Two-Phase Expansion Plan

## Phase 1: Productionize and Polish the Current Platform (Weeks 1‑8)

**Vision:** Deliver a stable, content-rich AWS learning experience that is ready for paying users and enterprise pilots.

- **Stabilize Core Experience**
  - Harden auth/session flows; add graceful error handling around Clerk and Stripe integrations.
  - Implement observability stack (Sentry + structured logging) and uptime alerts.
  - Performance tune lesson loading and server actions; target <200 ms TTFB for lesson fetches.
- **Complete Feature Set**
  - Finish Cloud Practitioner pathway (150+ questions, scenario-based challenges, mini labs).
  - Expand leaderboard with cohorts (teams, companies) and weekly seasons.
  - Ship progress dashboard with certification readiness scoring and study streaks.
- **Operational Readiness**
  - Build admin QA workflow (draft → review → publish) with content diffing.
  - Automate schema migrations/seed rotations via CI; add blue/green deploy playbook.
  - Draft security checklist (PII review, rate limiting, audit logs) and privacy policy.
- **Engagement & Monetization**
  - Launch guided onboarding with persona-based study plans.
  - Add Stripe metering for team accounts; support invoice billing for enterprise.
  - Stand up feedback loop (in-app NPS, Intercom-style support inbox).
- **Milestones & KPIs**
  - Week 2: instrumentation live, incident response docs drafted.
  - Week 4: content completion + admin workflow; NPS baseline ≥30.
  - Week 6: progress analytics + cohort leaderboard; crash-free sessions ≥99%.
  - Week 8: production launch candidate with rollout checklist; churn <10% in pilot cohort.

## Phase 2: Chrome Built-In AI Hackathon Initiative (Weeks 9‑16)

**Theme:** “AWS Cloud Sidekick” – a Chrome-integrated learning companion powered by on-device Gemini Nano APIs, delivering privacy-first, offline-friendly study guidance.

- **Flagship Experiences (Built with Chrome AI APIs)**
  - `Prompt API`: On-page context-aware mentor that generates adaptive quiz variants and drills tied to what the learner is browsing (e.g., AWS docs, architecture blogs).
  - `Summarizer API`: One-click condensation of dense AWS whitepapers into certification-aligned briefs with callouts and flashcards.
  - `Writer + Rewriter APIs`: Guided lab journal that helps learners draft architecture justifications, then iteratively improves clarity, tone, and AWS best-practice alignment.
  - `Proofreader API`: Instant feedback on free-form answers, spotting AWS terminology misuse and suggesting improvements before submission.
  - `Translator API`: Dual-language study mode to expand reach among non-English speakers with locale-aware terminology glossaries.
- **Form Factor & Reach**
  - Ship as a hybrid: Chrome Extension overlay + complementary PWA so learners can stay engaged across desktop/mobile.
  - Offline-first caching of lessons, generated flashcards, and user progress via IndexedDB + background sync.
  - Social/cohort features using WebRTC for real-time study jams, with AI-generated prompts fueling collaboration.
- **Hackathon Deliverables**
  - New GitHub repo branch or companion repo with OSS license, setup scripts, and CLI to enable Chrome AI APIs.
  - Demo video storyboard: intro problem, live extension walkthrough, offline scenario, recap metrics.
  - Submission playbook covering API usage rationale, privacy posture (all inference on-device), and scalability story (extensible to other certifications).
- **Implementation Roadmap**
  1. Weeks 9‑10: Prototype Chrome extension scaffolding, secure Early Preview access, validate Prompt API UX.
  2. Weeks 11‑12: Build Summarizer + Writer flows, integrate offline caching, run hallway tests with 5 beta learners.
  3. Weeks 13‑14: Polish UI/visual storytelling (badge animations, dark mode), finalize analytics and accessibility pass.
  4. Weeks 15‑16: Record demo, craft submission narrative, launch private beta to gather testimonials.
- **Judging Criteria Alignment**
  - **Functionality:** Modular AI pipelines, multi-language support, reusable content adapters for other certs.
  - **Purpose:** Removes friction in translating AWS docs into actionable study steps; unlocks proactive, contextual coaching.
  - **Content & UX:** Gamified, polished UI with AI-generated visuals and interactive labs; onboarding wizard explains AI behaviors.
  - **Technological Execution:** Demonstrates five Chrome AI APIs working client-side with privacy assurances and fallback strategies.
- **Risks & Mitigations**
  - API availability → enroll early in preview, keep feature flags for fallback web workers.
  - Performance on lower-end devices → lazy-load models, offer lightweight mode using summaries only.
  - Compliance/privacy → document local processing flow, offer data export/delete controls.

**Next Steps**
- Socialize plan with stakeholders, lock phase timelines, and assign owners.
- Register for Chrome Built-in AI Early Preview + hackathon, note submission deadlines.
- Align design, engineering, and content teams on shared backlog using this plan as the roadmap baseline.
