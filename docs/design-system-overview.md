# Enhanced Design System Overview

The enhanced AWS Learning Platform design system delivers a production-ready toolkit with semantic tokens, responsive foundations, and interactive documentation that power consistent UI across the app.

## Highlights
- Semantic color, typography, spacing, and motion tokens optimised for accessibility.
- Component recipes built with CVA, animation presets, and playground-ready documentation.
- AWS service theming and gamification elements for streaks, XP, and achievements.
- Performance-minded approach: zero-runtime tokens, GPU-friendly motion, and tree-shakable exports.

## Design Foundations
**Colors** — Brand palette (green, blue, gold), AWS service hues, status feedback, and gamification tiers.  
**Typography** — Inter-based heading/body scales with responsive `clamp()` sizing and UI/gamification variants.  
**Spacing** — 4px base scale with semantic layout, component, and interaction spacing tokens.  
**Motion** — Duration scale from immediate to slower, easing presets (swift, gentle, bouncy, elastic), and reusable animation patterns (entrance, exit, micro-interactions).

## Component System
- Interactive documentation includes color palettes, typography showcases, spacing demos, animation previews, and configurable playgrounds.
- Core building blocks cover buttons, badges, cards, onboarding flows, analytics dashboards, progress trackers, and reward surfaces.
- Recipes emphasise accessibility defaults (ARIA roles, reduced motion support) and provide TypeScript prop docs.

## Responsive & Accessibility Standards
- Breakpoints: `sm` (640px), `md` (768px), `lg` (1024px), `xl` (1280px), `2xl` (1536px).  
- Responsive padding, max-width constraints, and fluid typography maintain readable layouts.  
- WCAG AA contrast compliance, optional AAA support for critical text, and `prefers-reduced-motion` handling baked into motion utilities.

## Gamification & Learning Touches
- Achievement tiers, streak indicators, and XP progress visualisations share a unified color + motion language.  
- Celebration and feedback animations communicate progress without overwhelming learners.

## Performance Considerations
- Tokens compile to CSS custom properties for zero-runtime usage.  
- Component variants stay tree-shakable; heavy docs tooling loads lazily.  
- Motion utilities favour transform/opacity for GPU acceleration.

## Contributing
1. Add or update tokens in `foundations/`, including TypeScript typings and docs.  
2. Build new components with CVA, accessibility attributes, and matching documentation demos.  
3. Extend animation presets through `animationUtils.createTransition` for consistent motion.  
4. Update interactive docs when introducing new foundations or component capabilities.

## Reference Resources
- Material Design 3, Apple HIG, Duolingo Design, and AWS Cloudscape for interaction patterns.  
- Class Variance Authority, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and WCAG 2.1 guidelines for technical implementation.
