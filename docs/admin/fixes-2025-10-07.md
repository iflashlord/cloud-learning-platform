# Admin Panel Bug Fixes - October 7, 2025

## Overview
Three critical usability issues were identified and fixed in the admin panel to improve the question and answer management workflow.

---

## üîß Issue #1: "View Questions" Button Not Working
**Problem:** In the "All Lessons" tab of the course editor, clicking "View Questions" didn't work properly.

**Root Cause:** The ShowButton was trying to show the lesson record itself, but there was no lesson show view configured.

**Solution:**
1. Created a new **Lesson Show View** (`app/admin/lesson/show.tsx`)
2. Registered the show view in `app/admin/app.tsx`
3. Updated the "View Questions" button in course editor to properly navigate to the lesson show page

**New Features Added:**
- Lesson overview with statistics (total questions, question types breakdown)
- Complete list of all questions in that lesson
- Quick stats card showing Multiple Choice vs Fill in Blank counts
- Direct edit/delete buttons for each question
- "Add New Question" button that pre-populates the lesson ID

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `app/admin/course/edit.tsx` - Updated ShowButton
- ‚úÖ `app/admin/lesson/show.tsx` - NEW FILE created
- ‚úÖ `app/admin/app.tsx` - Registered LessonShow component

## üîß Issue #2: Edit Question - Show Only Associated Answers
**Problem:** When editing a question, there was no easy way to add new answers, and the relationship between the question and its answers wasn't clear.

**Root Cause:** The CreateButton for adding answers didn't pre-populate the `challengeId` field, forcing users to manually select the question again.

**Solution:**
1. Wrapped CreateButton in a `FunctionField` to access the current record
2. Pre-populate `challengeId` using `state={{ record: { challengeId: record?.id } }}`
3. The answer creation form now automatically knows which question it belongs to

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ When clicking "Add New Answer Option" from a question edit page, the question is automatically selected
- ‚úÖ Reduces errors (users can't accidentally add answers to wrong question)
- ‚úÖ Faster workflow (one less dropdown to fill)
- ‚úÖ Clear parent-child relationship

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `app/admin/challenge/edit.tsx` - Updated CreateButton with pre-populated challengeId
- ‚úÖ `app/admin/challengeOption/create.tsx` - Ready to accept pre-populated challengeId

---

## üîß Issue #3: Preview & Test Tab Not Working
**Problem:** The "Preview & Test" tab showed a placeholder message saying "coming soon" instead of actually previewing the question.

**Solution:** Implemented a **full interactive preview** with:

### Preview Features:
1. **Visual Question Display**
   - Shows question text in large, clear typography
   - Displays question type (Multiple Choice / Fill in Blank)
   - AWS-themed styling matching the admin interface

2. **Answer Options Preview**
   - Shows all answer options with A, B, C, D labels
   - Correct answer highlighted in green with ‚úì badge
   - Wrong answers shown in gray
   - Visual indicators for images/audio if present

3. **Smart Validation Warnings**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Error if no correct answer is marked
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Error if multiple correct answers (should be only 1)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning if less than 2 answer options
   - ‚úÖ Success message when question is ready

4. **Testing Checklist**
   - Question clarity check
   - Minimum answer count (2+)
   - Single correct answer verification
   - Plausible wrong answers reminder
   - Media accessibility check

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ See exactly how students will see the question
- ‚úÖ Catch errors before publishing (wrong answer count, multiple correct answers)
- ‚úÖ Validate question quality
- ‚úÖ No need to navigate to live lesson to test

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `app/admin/challenge/edit.tsx` - Replaced placeholder with full preview implementation
