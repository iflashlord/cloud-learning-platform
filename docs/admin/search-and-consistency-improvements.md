- Multi-field search capability

**Improvements:**
- Consistent header implementation
- Search integration with pagination
- Better empty states
- Responsive design improvements

## Technical Implementation

### Consistent State Management
```typescript
// Standard state pattern across all admin pages
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");
const [filter, setFilter] = useState("all");
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);

// Automatic pagination reset on filter changes
useEffect(() => {
  setCurrentPage(1);
}, [searchTerm, filter]);
```

### Unified Filtering Logic
```typescript
// Standard filtering pattern
const filteredItems = items.filter(item => {
  const matchesSearch = item.field.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
  const matchesFilter = filter === "all" || item.status === filter;
  return matchesSearch && matchesFilter;
});
```

### Consistent Empty States
- No data state: Encouraging action with "Add" button
- No results state: Helpful messaging about adjusting search/filters
- Loading state: Consistent spinner implementation
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

## UX/UI Improvements

### 1. Visual Consistency
- **Unified Typography**: Consistent heading sizes, weights, and colors
- **Spacing Standards**: Standardized margins, padding, and gaps
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent use of brand colors across components
- **Icon Usage**: Proper icon sizing, positioning, and semantic meaning

### 2. Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First**: All search and filter components work on mobile
- **Breakpoint Consistency**: Unified responsive behavior
- **Touch-Friendly**: Proper button sizes for mobile interaction
- **Layout Adaptation**: Components adapt gracefully to different screen sizes

### 3. Interaction Patterns
- **Instant Search**: Real-time filtering without submit buttons
- **Clear Actions**: Easy-to-find clear buttons for search inputs
- **Visual Feedback**: Active states, hover effects, and loading indicators
- **Keyboard Support**: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Client-Side Filtering**: Fast, responsive search without server requests
- **Efficient Rendering**: Only rendering visible items with pagination
- **Debounced Search**: Smooth typing experience without lag
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and state management

## Accessibility Improvements

### ARIA Labels and Semantic HTML
- Proper labels for search inputs
