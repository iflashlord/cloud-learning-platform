# Coupon Revoke Implementation - /pro Page

## Overview

Added the ability for users to revoke/cancel their coupon trial directly from the `/pro` page for better user experience and control.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Pro Upgrade Main Component (`app/(main)/pro/pro-upgrade-main.tsx`)

#### Added Imports

- Imported `X` icon from `lucide-react`
- Imported `cancelMyCouponRedemption` function from `@/actions/coupon`

#### Added State Management

- Added `cancelPending` state for managing cancel button loading state
- Added `startCancelTransition` for handling async cancel operations

#### Added Cancel Handler

```typescript
const handleCancelCoupon = () => {
  startCancelTransition(() => {
    cancelMyCouponRedemption()
      .then((response) => {
        toast.success(response.message || "Coupon trial cancelled successfully!")
        window.location.href = "/learn"
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        toast.error(error.message || "Something went wrong. Please try again.")
      })
  })
}
```

#### Enhanced Coupon User Banner

- Added a prominent "Cancel Trial" button in the coupon user banner
- Button shows loading state during cancellation
- Includes clear messaging about returning to free tier
- Red styling to indicate destructive action

#### Enhanced Coupon Tab Section

- Added a subtle cancel option within the coupon tab
- Provides alternative access point for trial cancellation
- Link-style button for less prominent access

### 2. User Experience Improvements

#### Visual Indicators

- Red color scheme for cancel buttons to indicate destructive action
- Loading spinners during cancel operation
- Clear messaging about consequences ("Return to free tier anytime")

#### Multiple Access Points

1. **Primary**: Prominent button in the coupon banner at top of page
2. **Secondary**: Subtle link in the coupon tab section

#### Feedback System

- Success toast notification when cancellation completes
- Error toast for any cancellation failures
- Automatic redirect to `/learn` page after successful cancellation

## Backend Integration

The implementation leverages the existing `cancelMyCouponRedemption` server action which:

- Validates user authentication
- Finds active coupon redemption
- Deactivates the redemption in database
- Revalidates relevant UI paths
- Returns success/error messages

## User Flow

1. **User with active coupon visits `/pro` page**
2. **Sees coupon banner with trial information**
3. **Clicks "Cancel Trial" button (either location)**
4. **Button shows loading state**
5. **Server processes cancellation**
6. **User sees success/error message**
7. **Redirected to `/learn` page with updated status**

## Benefits

- **User Control**: Users can easily exit their trial at any time
- **Clear UI**: Multiple intuitive access points for cancellation
- **Feedback**: Clear visual and textual feedback throughout process
- **Consistency**: Maintains design system patterns and styling
- **Reliability**: Uses existing tested server actions for data operations

## Testing

The implementation is ready for testing with:

1. Create a test coupon via admin interface
2. Redeem coupon as a user
3. Navigate to `/pro` page
4. Verify cancel buttons appear and function correctly
5. Confirm proper state transitions and redirects

## Code Quality

- TypeScript strict typing maintained
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Consistent with existing component patterns
- Accessible button styling and states
- Responsive design considerations
