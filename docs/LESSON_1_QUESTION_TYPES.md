## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
All questions are stored in the `challenges` table with appropriate type fields:
```sql
- type: ENUM('SELECT', 'ASSIST', 'TRUE_FALSE', 'DRAG_DROP', 'TEXT_INPUT', 'IMAGE_SELECT', 'LISTENING')
- correctAnswer: TEXT (for TEXT_INPUT questions)
- audioSrc: TEXT (for LISTENING questions)
- imageSrc: TEXT (for IMAGE_SELECT main images)
```

### Answer Options
Stored in `challenge_options` table with enhanced fields:
```sql
- order: INTEGER (for DRAG_DROP sequencing)
- imageSrc: TEXT (for IMAGE_SELECT option images)
- correct: BOOLEAN (not used for DRAG_DROP or TEXT_INPUT)
```

### Validation Logic
Each question type has specific validation:

- **SELECT/ASSIST/TRUE_FALSE/IMAGE_SELECT/LISTENING**: Correct option matching
- **TEXT_INPUT**: Case-insensitive string comparison with expected answer
- **SPEECH_INPUT**: Speech-to-text transcription with case-insensitive string comparison
- **DRAG_DROP**: Order sequence validation (items must be in correct positions)

## Admin Interface

All question types can be created and managed through the admin panel:
1. Go to `/admin/challenges`
2. Click "New Challenge" 
3. Select question type from dropdown
4. Form fields adapt based on selected type
5. Add appropriate options and media URLs

## Notes

- **Media Files**: The seed includes placeholder URLs for images and audio files
- **Responsive Design**: All question types work on desktop and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard shortcuts and screen reader support
- **Progress Tracking**: All types integrate with the existing progress system
- **Hearts System**: All types respect the hearts/lives mechanism

## Next Steps

1. **Add Real Media**: Replace placeholder URLs with actual image and audio files
2. **More Examples**: Add more questions of each type to other lessons
3. **Analytics**: Track which question types are most effective for learning
4. **Customization**: Allow instructors to customize validation rules per question
