# Chrome AI Built-in APIs Integration

## Overview

The AI Learning Assistant now uses Chrome's Built-in AI APIs instead of external chat services. This provides:

- **Offline AI capabilities** using Gemini Nano model
- **Privacy-focused** - No data sent to external servers
- **Fast responses** - Local processing
- **No API costs** - Built into the browser

## Features

### Quick AI Actions

- **Explain Concepts**: Get clear explanations of lesson content
- **Real Examples**: See practical applications of what you learned
- **Study Tips**: Get personalized study strategies
- **Avoid Mistakes**: Learn about common pitfalls
- **Quick Quiz**: Test your understanding with AI-generated questions

### Custom Questions

- Ask any question about the lesson content
- Get contextual answers based on your specific lesson data
- AI understands your score and progress

## Browser Requirements

### Chrome Canary (Recommended)

- Download Chrome Canary: <https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/>
- Enable AI features in chrome://flags/
- Look for "Optimization Guide On Device Model" and "AI for Compose" flags

### Chrome Flags to Enable

1. Open `chrome://flags/`
2. Search for and enable:
   - `#optimization-guide-on-device-model`
   - `#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`
   - `#ai-for-compose`
3. Restart Chrome

## Implementation Details

### Chrome AI API Usage

```typescript
// Check if Chrome AI is available
if (window.ai?.assistant) {
  const session = await window.ai.assistant.create({
    systemPrompt: "Your AI tutor prompt here...",
    temperature: 0.7,
    topK: 8,
  })
  
  const response = await session.prompt("Your question here")
}
```

### Component Structure

- **AILearningAssistant**: Main component that provides AI assistance
- **Chrome AI Detection**: Automatically detects if Chrome AI is available
- **Fallback UI**: Shows setup instructions if Chrome AI is not available
- **Session Management**: Properly initializes and cleans up AI sessions

## Benefits vs Chat Interface

### Old Chat Interface
