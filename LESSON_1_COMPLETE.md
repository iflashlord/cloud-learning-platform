## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

I have successfully added **all 7 different question types** to Lesson 1 of the AWS Learning Platform. Users can now experience the full range of interactive learning capabilities in a single lesson.

## 🔍 What's in Lesson 1 Now

### 7 Questions Demonstrating Each Type:

1. **📋 Multiple Choice (SELECT)**
   - "What is Cloud Computing?"

3. **✅❌ True/False (TRUE_FALSE)**
   - "Cloud computing eliminates the need for physical data centers completely."
   - Simple binary choice question

4. **⌨️ Text Input (TEXT_INPUT)**
   - "What does AWS stand for? (Type the full name)"
   - Free text input with case-insensitive validation

5. **🔄 Drag & Drop Ordering (DRAG_DROP)**
   - "Arrange these cloud service models from lowest to highest abstraction level"
   - Interactive drag-and-drop with IaaS → PaaS → SaaS ordering

6. **🖼️ Image Selection (IMAGE_SELECT)**
   - "Which image represents the AWS cloud icon?"
   - Visual selection between AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud icons

7. **🔊 Listening Comprehension (LISTENING)**
