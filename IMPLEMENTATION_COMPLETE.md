- Support for `prefers-contrast: high` media query

### ✅ 4. Single Background System
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Created `BackgroundProvider` component in `enhanced-layout-system.tsx`

- Single source of truth for all app backgrounds
- Consistent overscroll behavior
- Theme-aware background switching

### ✅ 5. Sticky Header in /learn with Proper Colors
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Created `EnhancedLearnHeader` component with proper sticky positioning
- `EnhancedStickyHeader` wrapper with backdrop blur and theme-aware colors
- Perfect color matching with background in both light and dark modes
- Responsive progress cards with smooth animations
- Updated `/learn` page to use enhanced components

### ✅ 6. Improved Sidebar
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Created `EnhancedSidebar` component with collapsible functionality
- Smooth animations for expand/collapse behavior
- Better visual hierarchy and contrast
- Enhanced mobile drawer (`EnhancedMobileSidebar`) with proper touch interactions
- Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Theme switcher integration and user profile section

### ✅ 7. Full Responsiveness with Component and Project Level Switches
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Mobile-first responsive design approach throughout
- `useResponsive` hook for component-level responsive behavior
- `ShowOn` component for conditional rendering based on screen size
- Responsive grid system (`ResponsiveGrid`) with configurable breakpoints
- Enhanced mobile header (`EnhancedMobileHeader`) with proper mobile behavior
- Seamless transitions between mobile/desktop layouts

## 🚀 How to Use

### Enhanced Components
```tsx
// Enhanced Button with theme support
<EnhancedButton variant="primary" size="lg" loading={isLoading}>
  Click me
</EnhancedButton>

// Enhanced Card with status
<EnhancedCard variant="success" padding="lg">
  <h3>Success!</h3>
  <p>Operation completed.</p>
</EnhancedCard>

// Enhanced App Layout  
<EnhancedAppLayoutComponent
  activeCourse={course}
  hearts={hearts}
